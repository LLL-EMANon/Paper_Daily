## 1. Multimodal Large Language Models as Image Classifiers

**Meta**
- Authors: Nikita Kisel, Illia Volkov, Klara Janouskova, Jiri Matas
- Published: 2026-03-07
- arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.06578v1

**Abstract**
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) classification performance depends critically on evaluation protocol and ground truth quality. Studies comparing MLLMs with supervised and vision-language models report conflicting conclusions, and we show these conflicts stem from protocols that either inflate or underestimate performance. Across the most common evaluation protocols, we identify and fix key issues: model outputs that fall outside the provided class list and are discarded, inflated results from weak multiple-choice distractors, and an open-world setting that underperforms only due to poor output mapping. We additionally quantify the impact of commonly overlooked design choices - batch size, image ordering, and text encoder selection - showing they substantially affect accuracy. Evaluating on ReGT, our multilabel reannotation of 625 ImageNet-1k classes, reveals that MLLMs benefit most from corrected labels (up to +10.8%), substantially narrowing the perceived gap with supervised models. Much of the reported MLLMs underperformance on classification is thus an artifact of noisy ground truth and flawed evaluation protocol rather than genuine model deficiency. Models less reliant on supervised training signals prove most sensitive to annotation quality. Finally, we show that MLLMs can assist human annotators: in a controlled case study, annotators confirmed or integrated MLLMs predictions in approximately 50% of difficult cases, demonstrating their potential for large-scale dataset curation.

**Meta**
- Authors: Lijiang Li, Zuwei Long, Yunhang Shen, Heting Gao, Haoyu Cao, Xing Sun, Caifeng Shan, Ran He, Chaoyou Fu
- Published: 2026-03-07
- arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.06577v1

**Abstract**
While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made impressive strides, they predominantly employ a conventional autoregressive architecture as their backbone, leaving significant room to explore effective and efficient alternatives in architectural design. Concurrently, recent studies have successfully applied discrete diffusion models to various domains, such as visual understanding and image generation, revealing their considerable potential as a promising backbone for multimodal systems. Drawing inspiration from these pioneering research, we introduce Omni-Diffusion, the first any-to-any multimodal language model built entirely on mask-based discrete diffusion models, which unifies understanding and generation across text, speech, and images. Omni-Diffusion employs a unified mask-based discrete diffusion model to directly capture the joint distribution over discrete multimodal tokens. This approach supports not only bimodal tasks but also more complex scenarios involving multiple modalities. On a diverse set of benchmarks, our method outperforms or performs on par with existing multimodal systems that process two or more modalities, highlighting the significant promise of diffusion models in powering the next generation of multimodal foundation models.

## 3. BEVLM: Distilling Semantic Knowledge from LLMs into Bird's-Eye View Representations

**Meta**
- Authors: Thomas Monninger, Shaoyuan Xie, Qi Alfred Chen, Sihao Ding
- Published: 2026-03-07
- arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.06576v1

**Abstract**
The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into autonomous driving has attracted growing interest for their strong reasoning and semantic understanding abilities, which are essential for handling complex decision-making and long-tail scenarios. However, existing methods typically feed LLMs with tokens from multi-view and multi-frame images independently, leading to redundant computation and limited spatial consistency. This separation in visual processing hinders accurate 3D spatial reasoning and fails to maintain geometric coherence across views. On the other hand, Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representations learned from geometrically annotated tasks (e.g., object detection) provide spatial structure but lack the semantic richness of foundation vision encoders. To bridge this gap, we propose BEVLM, a framework that connects a spatially consistent and semantically distilled BEV representation with LLMs. Through extensive experiments, we show that BEVLM enables LLMs to reason more effectively in cross-view driving scenes, improving accuracy by 46%, by leveraging BEV features as unified inputs. Furthermore, by distilling semantic knowledge from LLMs into BEV representations, BEVLM significantly improves closed-loop end-to-end driving performance by 29% in safety-critical scenarios.

## 4. Fly360: Omnidirectional Obstacle Avoidance within Drone View

**Meta**
- Authors: Xiangkai Zhang, Dizhe Zhang, WenZhuo Cao, Zhaoliang Wan, Yingjie Niu, Lu Qi, Xu Yang, Zhiyong Liu
- Published: 2026-03-07
- arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.06573v1

**Abstract**
Obstacle avoidance in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), as a fundamental capability, has gained increasing attention with the growing focus on spatial intelligence. However, current obstacle-avoidance methods mainly depend on limited field-of-view sensors and are ill-suited for UAV scenarios which require full-spatial awareness when the movement direction differs from the UAV's heading. This limitation motivates us to explore omnidirectional obstacle avoidance for panoramic drones with full-view perception. We first study an under explored problem setting in which a UAV must generate collision-free motion in environments with obstacles from arbitrary directions, and then construct a benchmark that consists of three representative flight tasks. Based on such settings, we propose Fly360, a two-stage perception-decision pipeline with a fixed random-yaw training strategy. At the perception stage, panoramic RGB observations are input and converted into depth maps as a robust intermediate representation. For the policy network, it is lightweight and used to output body-frame velocity commands from depth inputs. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that Fly360 achieves stable omnidirectional obstacle avoidance and outperforms forward-view baselines across all tasks.

## 5. SCOPE: Scene-Contextualized Incremental Few-Shot 3D Segmentation

**Meta**
- Authors: Vishal Thengane, Zhaochong An, Tianjin Huang, Son Lam Phung, Abdesselam Bouzerdoum, Lu Yin, Na Zhao, Xiatian Zhu
- Published: 2026-03-07
- arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.06572v1

**Abstract**
Incremental Few-Shot (IFS) segmentation aims to learn new categories over time from only a few annotations. Although widely studied in 2D, it remains underexplored for 3D point clouds. Existing methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting or fail to learn discriminative prototypes under sparse supervision, and often overlook a key cue: novel categories frequently appear as unlabelled background in base-training scenes. We introduce SCOPE (Scene-COntextualised Prototype Enrichment), a plug-and-play background-guided prototype enrichment framework that integrates with any prototype-based 3D segmentation method. After base training, a class-agnostic segmentation model extracts high-confidence pseudo-instances from background regions to build a prototype pool. When novel classes arrive with few labelled samples, relevant background prototypes are retrieved and fused with few-shot prototypes to form enriched representations without retraining the backbone or adding parameters. Experiments on ScanNet and S3DIS show that SCOPE achieves SOTA performance, improving novel-class IoU by up to 6.98% and 3.61%, and mean IoU by 2.25% and 1.70%, respectively, while maintaining low forgetting.

## 6. Third-order mixed electroweak-QCD corrections to the W-boson mass prediction from the muon lifetime

**Meta**
- Authors: Ievgen Dubovyk, Ayres Freitas, Janusz Gluza, Johann Usovitsch
- Published: 2026-03-07
- arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.06571v1

**Abstract**
We present the calculation of the so far missing ${\cal O}(α^2α_\mathrm{s})$ corrections to the quantity $Δr$, which relates the Fermi constant to the W-boson mass, and enables precision predictions of the latter. While the ${\cal O}(α^2α_\mathrm{s})$ corrections from diagrams with two closed fermion loops are already known, we here focus on the subset with one closed fermion loop, which is a substantially more complex problem. The calculation has been carried out through a combination of analytical and numerical techniques for the three-loop integrals and the on-shell renormalization. The impact of the new corrections is numerically significant, raising the Standard Model prediction for the W-boson mass by more than 3 MeV.

## 7. SUREON: A Benchmark and Vision-Language-Model for Surgical Reasoning

**Meta**
- Authors: Alejandra Perez, Anita Rau, Lee White, Busisiwe Mlambo, Chinedu Nwoye, Muhammad Abdullah Jamal, Omid Mohareri
- Published: 2026-03-07
- arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.06570v1

**Abstract**
Surgeons don't just see -- they interpret. When an expert observes a surgical scene, they understand not only what instrument is being used, but why it was chosen, what risk it poses, and what comes next. Current surgical AI cannot answer such questions, largely because training data that explicitly encodes surgical reasoning is immensely difficult to annotate at scale. Yet surgical video lectures already contain exactly this -- explanations of intent, rationale, and anticipation, narrated by experts for the purpose of teaching. Though inherently noisy and unstructured, these narrations encode the reasoning that surgical AI currently lacks. We introduce SUREON, a large-scale video QA dataset that systematically harvests this training signal from surgical academic videos. SUREON defines 12 question categories covering safety assessment, decision rationale, and forecasting, and uses a multi-agent pipeline to extract and structure supervision at scale. Across 134.7K clips and 170 procedure types, SUREON yields 206.8k QA pairs and an expert-validated benchmark of 354 examples. To evaluate the extent to which this supervision translates to surgical reasoning ability, we introduce two models: SureonVLM, a vision-language model adapted through supervised fine-tuning, and SureonVLM-R1, a reasoning model trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization. Both models can answer complex questions about surgery and substantially outperform larger general-domain models, exceeding 84% accuracy on the SUREON benchmark while outperforming general-domain models on standard surgical perception tasks. Qualitative analysis of SureonVLM-R1 reveals explicit reasoning behavior, such as inferring operative intent from visual context.

## 8. Penguin-VL: Exploring the Efficiency Limits of VLM with LLM-based Vision Encoders

**Meta**
- Authors: Boqiang Zhang, Lei Ke, Ruihan Yang, Qi Gao, Tianyuan Qu, Rossell Chen, Dong Yu, Leoweiliang
- Published: 2026-03-07
- arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.06569v1

**Abstract**
Vision Language Model (VLM) development has largely relied on scaling model size, which hinders deployment on compute-constrained mobile and edge devices such as smartphones and robots. In this work, we explore the performance limits of compact (e.g., 2B and 8B) VLMs. We challenge the prevailing practice that state-of-the-art VLMs must rely on vision encoders initialized via massive contrastive pretraining (e.g., CLIP/SigLIP). We identify an objective mismatch: contrastive learning, optimized for discrimination, enforces coarse and category-level invariances that suppress fine-grained visual cues needed for dense captioning and complex VLM reasoning. To address this issue, we present Penguin-VL, whose vision encoder is initialized from a text-only LLM. Our experiments reveal that Penguin-Encoder serves as a superior alternative to traditional contrastive pretraining, unlocking a higher degree of visual fidelity and data efficiency for multimodal understanding. Across various image and video benchmarks, Penguin-VL achieves performance comparable to leading VLMs (e.g., Qwen3-VL) in mathematical reasoning and surpasses them in tasks such as document understanding, visual knowledge, and multi-perspective video understanding. Notably, these gains are achieved with a lightweight architecture, demonstrating that improved visual representation rather than model scaling is the primary driver of performance. Our ablations show that Penguin-Encoder consistently outperforms contrastive-pretrained encoders, preserving fine-grained spatial and temporal cues that are critical for dense perception and complex reasoning. This makes it a strong drop-in alternative for compute-efficient VLMs and enables high performance in resource-constrained settings. Code: https://github.com/tencent-ailab/Penguin-VL

## 9. The Prevalence of Turbulence-Regulated Multiphase Galactic Winds in Star-Forming Galaxies

**Meta**
- Authors: Zhihui Li, Timothy Heckman, Max Gronke, Xinfeng Xu, Alaina Henry, Evan Schneider, Matthew Abruzzo, Danielle Berg, Bethan James, Crystal Martin, John Chisholm
- Published: 2026-03-07
- arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.06568v1

**Abstract**
We build upon our previously developed multi-ion radiative transfer (RT) framework, PEACOCK, to investigate the kinematic and energetic structure of cool-to-warm galactic winds in a sample of 50 nearby star-forming galaxies. Using self-consistent constraints derived from joint modeling of Ly-alpha and multiple ultraviolet metal lines, we analyze how bulk outflows and turbulent motions contribute to the dynamics and energy budget of galactic winds in the circumgalactic medium (CGM). We find that macroscopic turbulent velocities are often comparable to, and sometimes exceed, the coherent bulk outflow velocity. The associated turbulent pressure frequently dominates over both microscopic pressure and ram pressure, indicating that turbulence is a major contributor to the kinetic energy budget of the CGM wind. Wind kinematics, ionic column densities, and metal mass outflow rates all scale systematically with stellar mass and star formation rate, demonstrating a strong coupling between stellar feedback and CGM structure. Including turbulent motions strengthens these CGM-galaxy scaling relations and favors an energy-driven feedback regime. The total kinetic energy flux of the cool-to-warm CGM correlates tightly with the mechanical energy injection rate from star formation, implying that stellar feedback provides sufficient power to sustain both coherent outflows and turbulence. Comparisons with phenomenological line-profile fitting methods further show that simplified treatments can introduce systematic biases in inferred wind properties. Together these results support a turbulence-regulated picture of galactic winds in which a substantial fraction of feedback energy is stored in turbulent motions within a multiphase CGM.

## 10. A recipe for scalable attention-based MLIPs: unlocking long-range accuracy with all-to-all node attention

**Meta**
- Authors: Eric Qu, Brandon M. Wood, Aditi S. Krishnapriyan, Zachary W. Ulissi
- Published: 2026-03-07
- arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.06567v1

**Abstract**
Machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have advanced rapidly, with many top models relying on strong physics-based inductive biases. However, as models scale to larger systems like biomolecules and electrolytes, they struggle to accurately capture long-range (LR) interactions, leading current approaches to rely on explicit physics-based terms or components. In this work, we propose AllScAIP, a straightforward, attention-based, and energy-conserving MLIP model that scales to O(100 million) training samples. It addresses the long-range challenge using an all-to-all node attention component that is data-driven. Extensive ablations reveal that in low-data/small-model regimes, inductive biases improve sample efficiency. However, as data and model size scale, these benefits diminish or even reverse, while all-to-all attention remains critical for capturing LR interactions. Our model achieves state-of-the-art energy/force accuracy on molecular systems, as well as a number of physics-based evaluations (OMol25), while being competitive on materials (OMat24) and catalysts (OC20). Furthermore, it enables stable, long-timescale MD simulations that accurately recover experimental observables, including density and heat of vaporization predictions.
