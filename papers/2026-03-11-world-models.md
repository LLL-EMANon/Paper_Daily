## 1. Scale Space Diffusion

**Meta**
- Authors: Soumik Mukhopadhyay, Prateksha Udhayanan, Abhinav Shrivastava
- Published: 2026-03-10
- arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.08709v1

**Abstract**
Diffusion models degrade images through noise, and reversing this process reveals an information hierarchy across timesteps. Scale-space theory exhibits a similar hierarchy via low-pass filtering. We formalize this connection and show that highly noisy diffusion states contain no more information than small, downsampled images - raising the question of why they must be processed at full resolution. To address this, we fuse scale spaces into the diffusion process by formulating a family of diffusion models with generalized linear degradations and practical implementations. Using downsampling as the degradation yields our proposed Scale Space Diffusion. To support Scale Space Diffusion, we introduce Flexi-UNet, a UNet variant that performs resolution-preserving and resolution-increasing denoising using only the necessary parts of the network. We evaluate our framework on CelebA and ImageNet and analyze its scaling behavior across resolutions and network depths. Our project website ( https://prateksha.github.io/projects/scale-space-diffusion/ ) is available publicly.

**Meta**
- Authors: Haoyang Li, Liang Wang, Siyu Zhou, Jiacheng Sun, Jing Jiang, Chao Wang, Guodong Long, Yan Peng
- Published: 2026-03-10
- arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.08708v1

**Abstract**
CLIP-based prompt tuning enables pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to efficiently adapt to downstream tasks. Although existing studies have made significant progress, they pay limited attention to changes in the internal attention representations of VLMs during the tuning process. In this paper, we attribute the failure modes of prompt tuning predictions to shifts in foreground attention of the visual encoder, and propose Foreground View-Guided Prompt Tuning (FVG-PT), an adaptive plug-and-play foreground attention guidance module, to alleviate the shifts. Concretely, FVG-PT introduces a learnable Foreground Reliability Gate to automatically enhance the foreground view quality, applies a Foreground Distillation Compensation module to guide visual attention toward the foreground, and further introduces a Prior Calibration module to mitigate generalization degradation caused by excessive focus on the foreground. Experiments on multiple backbone models and datasets show the effectiveness and compatibility of FVG-PT. Codes are available at: https://github.com/JREion/FVG-PT

## 3. Impermanent: A Live Benchmark for Temporal Generalization in Time Series Forecasting

**Meta**
- Authors: Azul Garza, Renée Rosillo, Rodrigo Mendoza-Smith, David Salinas, Andrew Robert Williams, Arjun Ashok, Mononito Goswami, José Martín Juárez
- Published: 2026-03-10
- arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.08707v1

**Abstract**
Recent advances in time-series forecasting increasingly rely on pre-trained foundation-style models. While these models often claim broad generalization, existing evaluation protocols provide limited evidence. Indeed, most current benchmarks use static train-test splits that can easily lead to contamination as foundation models can inadvertently train on test data or perform model selection using test scores, which can inflate performance. We introduce Impermanent, a live benchmark that evaluates forecasting models under open-world temporal change by scoring forecasts sequentially over time on continuously updated data streams, enabling the study of temporal robustness, distributional shift, and performance stability rather than one-off accuracy on a frozen test set. Impermanent is instantiated on GitHub open-source activity, providing a naturally live and highly non-stationary dataset shaped by releases, shifting contributor behavior, platform/tooling changes, and external events. We focus on the top 400 repositories by star count and construct time series from issues opened, pull requests opened, push events, and new stargazers, evaluated over a rolling window with daily updates, alongside standardized protocols and leaderboards for reproducible, ongoing comparison. By shifting evaluation from static accuracy to sustained performance, Impermanent takes a concrete step toward assessing when and whether foundation-level generalization in time-series forecasting can be meaningfully claimed. Code and a live dashboard are available at https://github.com/TimeCopilot/impermanent and https://impermanent.timecopilot.dev.

## 4. Agentic Critical Training

**Meta**
- Authors: Weize Liu, Minghui Liu, Sy-Tuyen Ho, Souradip Chakraborty, Xiyao Wang, Furong Huang
- Published: 2026-03-10
- arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.08706v1

**Abstract**
Training large language models (LLMs) as autonomous agents often begins with imitation learning, but it only teaches agents what to do without understanding why: agents never contrast successful actions against suboptimal alternatives and thus lack awareness of action quality. Recent approaches attempt to address this by introducing self-reflection supervision derived from contrasts between expert and alternative actions. However, the training paradigm fundamentally remains imitation learning: the model imitates pre-constructed reflection text rather than learning to reason autonomously. We propose Agentic Critical Training (ACT), a reinforcement learning paradigm that trains agents to identify the better action among alternatives. By rewarding whether the model's judgment is correct, ACT drives the model to autonomously develop reasoning about action quality, producing genuine self-reflection rather than imitating it. Across three challenging agent benchmarks, ACT consistently improves agent performance when combined with different post-training methods. It achieves an average improvement of 5.07 points over imitation learning and 4.62 points over reinforcement learning. Compared to approaches that inject reflection capability through knowledge distillation, ACT also demonstrates clear advantages, yielding an average improvement of 2.42 points. Moreover, ACT enables strong out-of-distribution generalization on agentic benchmarks and improves performance on general reasoning benchmarks without any reasoning-specific training data, highlighting the value of our method. These results suggest that ACT is a promising path toward developing more reflective and capable LLM agents.

## 5. Evaluating Financial Intelligence in Large Language Models: Benchmarking SuperInvesting AI with LLM Engines

**Meta**
- Authors: Akshay Gulati, Kanha Singhania, Tushar Banga, Parth Arora, Anshul Verma, Vaibhav Kumar Singh, Agyapal Digra, Jayant Singh Bisht, Danish Sharma, Varun Singla, Shubh Garg
- Published: 2026-03-10
- arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.08704v1

**Abstract**
Large language models are increasingly used for financial analysis and investment research, yet systematic evaluation of their financial reasoning capabilities remains limited. In this work, we introduce the AI Financial Intelligence Benchmark (AFIB), a multi-dimensional evaluation framework designed to assess financial analysis capabilities across five dimensions: factual accuracy, analytical completeness, data recency, model consistency, and failure patterns. We evaluate five AI systems: GPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Claude, and SuperInvesting, using a dataset of 95+ structured financial analysis questions derived from real-world equity research tasks. The results reveal substantial differences in performance across models. Within this benchmark setting, SuperInvesting achieves the highest aggregate performance, with an average factual accuracy score of 8.96/10 and the highest completeness score of 56.65/70, while also demonstrating the lowest hallucination rate among evaluated systems. Retrieval-oriented systems such as Perplexity perform strongly on data recency tasks due to live information access but exhibit weaker analytical synthesis and consistency. Overall, the results highlight that financial intelligence in large language models is inherently multi-dimensional, and systems that combine structured financial data access with analytical reasoning capabilities provide the most reliable performance for complex investment research workflows.

## 6. HiAR: Efficient Autoregressive Long Video Generation via Hierarchical Denoising

**Meta**
- Authors: Kai Zou, Dian Zheng, Hongbo Liu, Tiankai Hang, Bin Liu, Nenghai Yu
- Published: 2026-03-10
- arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.08703v1

**Abstract**
Autoregressive (AR) diffusion offers a promising framework for generating videos of theoretically infinite length. However, a major challenge is maintaining temporal continuity while preventing the progressive quality degradation caused by error accumulation. To ensure continuity, existing methods typically condition on highly denoised contexts; yet, this practice propagates prediction errors with high certainty, thereby exacerbating degradation. In this paper, we argue that a highly clean context is unnecessary. Drawing inspiration from bidirectional diffusion models, which denoise frames at a shared noise level while maintaining coherence, we propose that conditioning on context at the same noise level as the current block provides sufficient signal for temporal consistency while effectively mitigating error propagation. Building on this insight, we propose HiAR, a hierarchical denoising framework that reverses the conventional generation order: instead of completing each block sequentially, it performs causal generation across all blocks at every denoising step, so that each block is always conditioned on context at the same noise level. This hierarchy naturally admits pipelined parallel inference, yielding a 1.8 wall-clock speedup in our 4-step setting. We further observe that self-rollout distillation under this paradigm amplifies a low-motion shortcut inherent to the mode-seeking reverse-KL objective. To counteract this, we introduce a forward-KL regulariser in bidirectional-attention mode, which preserves motion diversity for causal inference without interfering with the distillation loss. On VBench (20s generation), HiAR achieves the best overall score and the lowest temporal drift among all compared methods.

## 7. A Multi-Objective Optimization Approach for Sustainable AI-Driven Entrepreneurship in Resilient Economies

**Meta**
- Authors: Anas ALsobeh, Raneem Alkurdi
- Published: 2026-03-10
- arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.08692v1

**Abstract**
The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies presents both unprecedented opportunities and significant challenges for sustainable economic development. While AI offers transformative potential for addressing environmental challenges and enhancing economic resilience, its deployment often involves substantial energy consumption and environmental costs. This research introduces the EcoAI-Resilience framework, a multi-objective optimization approach designed to maximize the sustainability benefits of AI deployment while minimizing environmental costs and enhancing economic resilience. The framework addresses three critical objectives through mathematical optimization: sustainability impact maximization, economic resilience enhancement, and environmental cost minimization. The methodology integrates diverse data sources, including energy consumption metrics, sustainability indicators, economic performance data, and entrepreneurship outcomes across 53 countries and 14 sectors from 2015-2024. Our experimental validation demonstrates exceptional performance with R scores exceeding 0.99 across all model components, significantly outperforming baseline methods, including Linear Regression (R = 0.943), Random Forest (R = 0.957), and Gradient Boosting (R = 0.989). The framework successfully identifies optimal AI deployment strategies featuring 100\% renewable energy integration, 80% efficiency improvement targets, and optimal investment levels of $202.48 per capita. Key findings reveal strong correlations between economic complexity and resilience (r = 0.82), renewable energy adoption and sustainability outcomes (r = 0.71), and demonstrate significant temporal improvements in AI readiness (+1.12 points/year) and renewable energy adoption (+0.67 year) globally.

## 8. Split Federated Learning Architectures for High-Accuracy and Low-Delay Model Training

**Meta**
- Authors: Yiannis Papageorgiou, Yannis Thomas, Ramin Khalili, Iordanis Koutsopoulos
- Published: 2026-03-10
- arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.08687v1

**Abstract**
Can we find a network architecture for ML model training so as to optimize training loss (and thus, accuracy) in Split Federated Learning (SFL)? And can this architecture also reduce training delay and communication overhead? While accuracy is not influenced by how we split the model in ordinary, state-of-the-art SFL, in this work we answer the questions above in the affirmative. Recent Hierarchical SFL (HSFL) architectures adopt a three-tier training structure consisting of clients, (local) aggregators, and a central server. In this architecture, the model is partitioned at two partitioning layers into three sub-models, which are executed across the three tiers. Despite their merits, HSFL architectures overlook the impact of the partitioning layers and client-to-aggregator assignments on accuracy, delay, and overhead. This work explicitly captures the impact of the partitioning layers and client-to-aggregator assignments on accuracy, delay and overhead by formulating a joint optimization problem. We prove that the problem is NP-hard and propose the first accuracy-aware heuristic algorithm that explicitly accounts for model accuracy, while remaining delay-efficient. Simulation results on public datasets show that our approach can improve accuracy by 3%, while reducing delay by 20% and overhead by 50%, compared to state-of-the-art SFL and HSFL schemes.

## 9. Benchmarking Language Modeling for Lossless Compression of Full-Fidelity Audio

**Meta**
- Authors: Phillip Long, Zachary Novack, Chris Donahue
- Published: 2026-03-10
- arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.08683v1

**Abstract**
Autoregressive "language" models (LMs) trained on raw waveforms can be repurposed for lossless audio compression, but prior work is limited to 8-bit audio, leaving open whether such approaches work for practical settings (16/24-bit) and can compete with existing codecs. We benchmark LM-based compression on full-fidelity audio across diverse domains (music, speech, bioacoustics), sampling rates (16kHz-48kHz), and bit depths (8, 16, 24-bit). Standard sample-level tokenization becomes intractable at higher bit depths due to vocabulary size (65K for 16-bit; 16.7M for 24-bit). We propose Trilobyte, a byte-level tokenization schema for full resolution audio, improving vocabulary scaling from $O(2^{b})$ to $O(1)$ and enabling the first tractable 24-bit LM-based lossless compression. While LMs consistently outperform FLAC and yield state-of-the-art compression at 8-bit and 16-bit, we observe that compression gains become more modest as bit depth increases beyond 8-bit.

## 10. Structural Causal Bottleneck Models

**Meta**
- Authors: Simon Bing, Jonas Wahl, Jakob Runge
- Published: 2026-03-10
- arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.08682v1

**Abstract**
We introduce structural causal bottleneck models (SCBMs), a novel class of structural causal models. At the core of SCBMs lies the assumption that causal effects between high-dimensional variables only depend on low-dimensional summary statistics, or bottlenecks, of the causes. SCBMs provide a flexible framework for task-specific dimension reduction while being estimable via standard, simple learning algorithms in practice. We analyse identifiability in SCBMs, connect them to information bottlenecks in the sense of Tishby & Zaslavsky (2015), and illustrate how to estimate them experimentally. We also demonstrate the benefit of bottlenecks for effect estimation in low-sample transfer learning settings. We argue that SCBMs provide an alternative to existing causal dimension reduction frameworks like causal representation learning or causal abstraction learning.
